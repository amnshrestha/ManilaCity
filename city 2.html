                New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.  
                Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, 
                the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. New York City has been described as the cultural, 
                financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[13] entertainment, research, 
                technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United

                <li>History
                    <p>The "Sons of Liberty" campaigned against British authority in New York City, and the Stamp Act Congress of representatives from throughout the Thirteen Colonies met in the city in 1765 to organize resistance to Crown policies. The city's strategic location and status as a major seaport made it the prime target for British seizure in 1776. General George Washington lost a series of battles from which he narrowly escaped (with the notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first victory of the war), and the British Army occupied New York and made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting Loyalist refugees. The city served as the national capital under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1789, and briefly served as the new nation's capital in 1789–90 under the United States Constitution.
