            <p>
                Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe CountyThe city 
                of Rochester forms the core of a much larger metropolitan area with a population of around 
                1.1 million people, across six counties.
                Rochester was one of the United States' first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile Genesee 
                River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing center, which 
                spurred further rapid population growth. The city rose to prominence as the birthplace and home of 
                some of America's most iconic companies, by which the region became a global center for science, 
                technology, and research and development.

                <li>History
                    <p>Settlement began in the late 18th century, and the city flourished with the opening of the Erie Canal. It became a major manufacturing center, and attracted many Italians, Germans, Irish and other immigrants, as well as a dominant group of Yankees of New England origin. The Yankees made Rochester the center of multiple reform movements, such as abolitionism and women's rights. It was famous as the center of the American photography industry, with headquarters of Eastman Kodak. In the 1970s it became fashionable to call the industrial cities along the Great Lakes 'rustbelt cities' following the move away from steel, chemical and other hard goods manufacturing. Rochester, with the presence of Ritter-Pfaulder, Bausch and Lomb, Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Gannett and other major industries, defied the trend for many decades following WWII.
